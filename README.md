Hospital Mortality Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of mortality for hospitalized patients. By leveraging various patient data, the model can assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients and making informed decisions to improve patient outcomes.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate and reliable predictive model that can be used in clinical settings to foresee patient mortality. This can help in timely intervention and resource allocation, ultimately improving the quality of care and saving lives.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw hospital data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features that significantly impact patient outcomes.
Model Selection: Comparing various machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training the selected model on historical data and evaluating its performance using standard metrics.
Deployment: Implementing the model for real-time predictions in a clinical setting.
Data
The dataset used in this project comprises patient information such as demographic details, vital signs, laboratory test results, and medical history. For confidentiality reasons, the actual dataset is not included in this repository. However, a sample synthetic dataset is provided for demonstration purposes.
